# cot-4500-as3
This is the 3rd assignment for my numerical calculus class in UCF.
Chapter 5 and 6 material are covered over this assignment.

Keeping true to adding industry likeness to each assignment, it is required that you need to
include a README per repository. A README is a file used to describe a repo’s purpose, include
compilation purposes, or both. A proper README.md is typically filled out with sections, akin to
an essay.
For this assignment, a README needs to be included and filled out. The amount of info you put
into the README is up to you, but you will need the following at least:
• Mention of requirements.txt
o No need to include this UNLESS you plan on using a library other than NumPy
• Mention of running python
o Since we require instructions on to run, you will need to include the command to
run the script from command line.
RESTRICTIONS
Please avoid using the scipy library for this assignment. You will need to be able to do the
decomposition without the use of this external library
